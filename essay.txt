The Will to Power: The Antidote to Boredom?
While one might argue that stimulation or activity is the antithesis of boredom, I contend that it is a result of a lack of involvement in the outside world. To counteract boredom, one must not only acquire information but also engage in action and observe its effects on the external world. This desire of controlling and influencing one's environment is central to Existentialism and is described by Nietzsche as the "will to power," which he considers to be the most fundamental drive of human nature (GM I:13). However, our fixation on the will to power can sometimes lead us to act maliciously and ignore the adverse effects of our actions. While they are renowned as notable works of literature, Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and Hoffmannshal's The Lord Chandos Letter incorporate a significant amount of existentialist theory, unapologetically exploring themes of boredom and the will to power. In both Hedda Gabler and The Lord Chandos Letter, boredom is portrayed in distinct ways, yet both works highlight the idea that the antithesis of boredom is the ability to act by exerting influence over one's surroundings and asserting free will. Ultimately, these works demonstrate the instinctual desire to exert one's will to power to combat boredom and affirm one's existence in the world.
In Henrik Ibsen's play Hedda Gabler, the title character's boredom is a driving force behind her actions. Hedda is a complex character who is dissatisfied with her life and her marriage to George Tesman, leading her to manipulate and control those around her. Although she tries to justify her actions as being for the benefit of others, such as hiding and burning a manuscript that could harm her husband, it becomes clear that she is mainly driven by a desire for power and control (HG, 3:104). In this case it is clear because she does not love or care for her husband or his career. Another of many examples is consciously referring to Aunt Julle’s bonnet as the maid’s hat, just to see a reaction out of Julle (HG 1:9). Hedda performs these drastic acts seemingly oblivious to the consequences they may have, but these effects to her actions give her a notion of power. The stimulation from the sense of power and control over her surrounding world turns into an addiction, which quickly escalates into the shedding of blood. Hedda's detachment from her environment and lack of awareness about the consequences of her actions only exacerbate her addiction. The play also demonstrates Hedda feeling detached from her environment, often being unaware that her actions have consequences. Hedda recklessly entrusts Eilert with a loaded gun, seemingly oblivious to the potential devastation it could bring, a choice that any rational individual would recognize as unwise, particularly when dealing with someone prone to self-destructive behavior. These actions are driven by a desire to assert her power and control over her environment, and to feel a sense of agency in her life. Hedda seems to lose touch with the negative consequences that her actions may have, thinking only about the sense of empowerment that she gets when she sees that her actions have significant impact on her environment. Hedda's addiction to power and control through her actions is, in a way, a manifestation of her desire to assert her free will. By acting on her boredom, she is able to shape her environment to suit her whims, demonstrating the ultimate ability of human will. Hedda’s disregard for consequences and her willingness to take risks highlight the extent of her obsession with power. It is through this obsession that she is able to assert herself in the world, even if it ultimately leads to a catastrophic spiral out of control. Hedda Gabler shows the supremacy of the will to power and the disregard from everything else, but not all examples of one’s detachment from reality necessarily conclude in an uncontrollable descent into catastrophe.
In contrast to Hedda Gabler, Hofmannsthal's The Lord Chandos Letter shows how boredom pushes Chandos to find both transcendence in mundane objects and a method to impact his environment. Chandos' Letter reveals how boredom has stripped the meaning and motivation from his life. He feels disconnected from the world around him and cannot find the words to communicate his innermost thoughts and feelings. As a result, he resorts to extreme measures, such as abandoning his writing and leaving society behind. But instead of using his detachment as an excuse to act maliciously or destructively, Chandos turns inward, seeking transcendence in random objects. Chandos finds meaning and purpose in the mundane, which allows him to reconnect with his environment and reinvigorate his sense of agency. He feels this sense of transcendence in regular objects like a watering can or a small piece of paper on the street, as well as during everyday experiences (LCL, 123). Instead of forcing him to act in a sometimes malicious manner, boredom has numbed Chandos into finding patches of fulfillment within his environment, it isn't until he finds a way to contribute to his environment that he would escape his boredom and lack of motivation. Chandos finishes his letter on a seemingly optimistic note, claiming that he has discovered a new form of language, which he calls a wordless language, that allows him to communicate with the world around him (LCL, 128). Whether or not this is true, this gives him the belief that he is able to communicate with, and therefore influence, his environment and helps him regain a sense of power. In suppressing his feelings of boredom, Lord Chandos finds transcendence in the mundane, and recovers motivation once he believes he has regained touch with his surroundings.
Both Hedda Gabler and Lord Chandos, despite having opposing reactions to boredom, ultimately demonstrate how the experience of boredom can drive individuals to act and assert influence over their environment in order to assert their free will. Hedda tries to escape her boredom by seeing the consequences of her actions, prioritizing her urge to control over any other desire or even her humanity towards the people close to her. Chandos seems to react to boredom in a largely different way, turning inward, finding meaning in the mundane, and rediscovering purpose when he finds an ability to interact and communicate with his surroundings. Drawing parallels between these two situations may not be immediately apparent, but upon closer examination, it becomes clear that the root cause underlying both is the same, and provides insight on how we tend to counteract boredom. Both characters seem to act based on a desire to exist, a necessity to be part of the world surrounding them. It is not far-fetched to extend this argument and posit a connection between acting to influence one's surroundings and acting to demonstrate free will. The Underground Man in Dostoevsky’s Notes From Underground frequently asserts that human behavior cannot be predicted or understood through logic or rationality alone. He suggests that humans often act purely to assert their free will, even if it goes against their own interests or defies explanation. For instance, he notes that sometimes we act out of spite or malice, not because it benefits us, but because it reaffirms our existence and our ability to exert our will on the world (NU, 8). He argues that this irrational behavior is what sets humans apart from machines or animals, and that it is a necessary part of our nature as conscious beings. Dostoevsky’s insight on free will matches Hedda and Chandos’ reaction to their boredom. Both characters went through great measures for self-confirmation of their existence and for reassurance that they have power over their surroundings.
Thus, it becomes clear that the opposite the boring is not merely just the interesting, but rather having the ability to act and assert one's free will. To counteract boredom, it's not enough to simply engage in stimulating activities; taking action and observing the positive effects of those actions is essential. When faced with boredom, the desire to exist and to be part of the world around us becomes heightened, leading us to act in ways that demonstrate our agency and our ability to affect our environment. This can manifest in different ways, as demonstrated by Hedda and Chandos, but the underlying motivation remains the same. While Hedda manipulates and controls those around her, fueled by a desire for power and control, Chandos seeks transcendence in mundane objects and experiences, and regains touch with his environment once he recovers a form of communication. Both, however, seemed to crave proof of self-existence. The connection between acting to influence one's surroundings and acting to demonstrate free will is clear in the irrational and unpredictable behavior that humans exhibit. Thus, it is evident that the act of asserting one's free will in order to influence one's surroundings is a natural and inevitable response to boredom, and a necessary expression of our human nature.
