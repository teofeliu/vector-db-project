## Intuition Behind Existence
The `services/` directory contains the core business logic of your application. It's designed to:
1. Implement complex operations that go beyond simple CRUD
2. Coordinate between different parts of the system
3. Encapsulate business rules and domain-specific logic
4. Provide a layer of abstraction between the API and the database operations

## High-Level Contents
1. `__init__.py`: Marks the directory as a Python package
2. `indexing/`: Subdirectory for indexing-related services
   - `base.py`: Defines base classes or interfaces for indexing
   - `vector_index.py`: Implements vector indexing algorithms
3. `vector_db.py`: Main service for vector database operations

## What It Does
1. Implements complex business logic and workflows
2. Coordinates operations that involve multiple models or database calls
3. Handles data processing, such as vector calculations and similarity searches
4. Implements domain-specific rules and validations

## What It Doesn't Do
1. Doesn't handle HTTP request/response cycle (that's in `api/`)
2. Doesn't directly interact with the database (uses `db/crud.py` for that)
3. Doesn't define data models or schemas (uses `models/` and `schemas/` for that)

## Relations with Other Components
1. Called by `api/` endpoints to perform operations
2. Uses `db/crud.py` for database operations
3. Utilizes `models/` for working with data structures
4. May use `schemas/` for data validation

## Detailed Breakdown

### `indexing/base.py`
- Purpose: Defines base classes or interfaces for indexing algorithms
- Provides a common structure for different indexing implementations

Example:
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import List, Tuple

class BaseIndex(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def add(self, vector: List[float], id: int):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def search(self, query: List[float], k: int) -> List[Tuple[int, float]]:
        pass
```

### `indexing/vector_index.py`
- Purpose: Implements specific vector indexing algorithms
- Handles the core functionality of vector similarity search

Example:
```python
import numpy as np
from .base import BaseIndex

class BruteForceIndex(BaseIndex):
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectors = []
        self.ids = []

    def add(self, vector: List[float], id: int):
        self.vectors.append(np.array(vector))
        self.ids.append(id)

    def search(self, query: List[float], k: int) -> List[Tuple[int, float]]:
        query_vector = np.array(query)
        distances = [np.linalg.norm(v - query_vector) for v in self.vectors]
        sorted_indices = np.argsort(distances)[:k]
        return [(self.ids[i], distances[i]) for i in sorted_indices]
```

### `vector_db.py`
- Purpose: Implements the main business logic for the vector database
- Coordinates between indexing, database operations, and API requests

Example:
```python
from .indexing.vector_index import BruteForceIndex
from app.db import crud
from app.schemas import ChunkCreate, DocumentCreate, LibraryCreate

class VectorDBService:
    def __init__(self, db_session):
        self.db = db_session
        self.index = BruteForceIndex()

    def create_library(self, library: LibraryCreate):
        return crud.create_library(self.db, library)

    def add_document(self, document: DocumentCreate, library_id: int):
        db_document = crud.create_document(self.db, document, library_id)
        for chunk in document.chunks:
            db_chunk = crud.create_chunk(self.db, chunk, db_document.id)
            self.index.add(chunk.embedding, db_chunk.id)
        return db_document

    def search(self, query_vector: List[float], k: int):
        results = self.index.search(query_vector, k)
        chunk_ids = [id for id, _ in results]
        chunks = crud.get_chunks_by_ids(self.db, chunk_ids)
        return chunks

```

The `services/` directory is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Business Logic Centralization**: It provides a single place for complex business logic, making the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

2. **Separation of Concerns**: It separates business logic from API handling and data access, adhering to the principle of separation of concerns.

3. **Reusability**: Services can be used by multiple API endpoints, promoting code reuse.

4. **Testability**: Business logic in services is easier to unit test as it's decoupled from API and database specifics.

5. **Scalability**: As the application grows, new services can be added without changing the overall structure.

This structure allows for a clean separation between the API layer, business logic, and data access layer, making the application more modular and easier to maintain and extend.
